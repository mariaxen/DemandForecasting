# DemandForecasting

This is the source code of my PhD project 'Application of Data Mining techniques to analyse and forecast water demand using smart metering data'. It is based on data from a UK case study, including time-series of water consumption from 2,000 households over 3 years, weather data, as well as metadata (household and customer characteristics). All data is confidential and could not become available.

It's divided into 3 folders:

1_import_clean: These are the scripts for importing and processing the data. 
2_statistical_analysis: Statistical analysis of the results, including the corresponding plots. 
3_demand_forecasting
